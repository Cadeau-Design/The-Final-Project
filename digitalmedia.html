       <h1>What is Digital Media and its influence on contemporary society</h1>
       
       <H2>Digital Media</H2>    
      <p>During the second half of the twentieth century, there was a shift from mechanical and analogue electronic technology to digital electronics. This led to the popularisation of digital devices like computers, smartphones, tablets, and watches, referred to as the Digital Revolution or the Third Industrial Revolution by many academics. The digital transformation process has been unfolding organically over the last few decades and has had profound implications in contemporary society. The evolution of technological advancements characterises it (Thompson, 2021; Smith, 2015; Sidhu, 2015; Schoenherr, 2004).</p>
      <br/>
      <p>According to Feldman (1997), a revolution happens when events move quickly and suddenly impact people's lives. Digital transformation has been a gradual process but has been significant. Acerbi (2016) suggests that digital culture is an evolutionary process requiring a population-level understanding of individual-level interactions. Cultural evolution offers an approach to perceiving digital media and influencing human behaviour. Digital media is constantly growing.</p> 
      <br/>
      <p>Kozinets, in his book Netnography: Redefined (2015), describes netnography as the appropriation of “social science methods to present a new approach to conducting ethical and thorough ethnographic research” (Kozinets, 2015, p. 2), often referred to as an adaptation of ethnography which aims to analyse human behaviour in online environments as a cultural phenomenon, combining participation and observation of conversations and interactions on the Internet, and "digital and network data collection, analysis and research"(Kozinets, 2015; Malhotra et al., 2017). </p>
      <br/>
      <p>Furthermore, netnography data is often described as "rich and naturalistic"; it offers researchers the ability to understand the lived realities of customers accurately, as it can be conducted in an "unobtrusive manner, offering researchers a view of customers" everyday lives" (Kozinets, 2015; Heinonen & Medberg, 2018). </p>
      <br/>
      <p>Smith (2013) writes that "digital" is anything directly related to using computers and their binary language on/off, 1/zero, bits and bytes. (Smith, 2013).</p>
      <br/>
      <p>The advent of Web 2.0 was a terminology popularised by Tim O'Reilly when he defined it as the “network as a platform, spanning all connected devices” (O’Reilly, 2007, pg 19) where users could generate content rather than just retrieve information. Web 2.0 facilitated the birth of digital media as it provided a new space for a "deep and rich experience" in which an unprecedented array of applications and technology facilitates more accessible access to information and faster interaction between people online (Strickland, 2007). Digital media is a two-way communication system; it offers the audience the possibility of interactivity, as opposed to traditional ways of mass media, mainly one-way communication systems (Smith, 2013). </p>
      <br/>
      <p>Dewdney and Ride (2014) state that some definitions of digital media focus primarily on computer technology, and others highlight the "cultural forms and contexts" in which technology is used. The authors add a third definition of "cultural concepts" as a set of "ideas, underlying theories and other discourses" that inform what a digital media practitioner does (Dewdney and Ride, 2014, pg 9). </p>
      <br/>
      <p>Bateman (2021) suggests that a digital medium is a medium in which its content is displayed in a "machine-readable form", or its production and promotion methods also involve information technologies. According to Acerbi (2016), a digital medium is a medium which is encoded in digital format and is transmitted and consumed on electronic/digital devices. </p>
      <br/>
      <p>Digital media refers to media stored in machine-readable formats such as digital videos, images, software, web pages, databases, digital audio, and e-books. It can be easily created, modified, shared, accessed, and preserved on digital electronic devices. Unlike print and other analogue media, digital media is not physical and can only be viewed on digital devices (Reyna et al., 2018; Edjudo, 2016; Selwyn, 2015; Shao, 2009; Dewdney & Ride, 2014; Van Dijck, 2009).
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>This research will mainly focus on websites as a digital medium and their implications in contemporary society. Furthermore, the subject of this study is how visual design influences people’s perception of the medium and how it impacts digital engagement.</p>

      <H2>The influence of digital media in today’s society</H2>
      <p>It is hard to deny that digital media positively or negatively impacts contemporary society. It is part of most people’s lives and has become an essential tool for us to navigate the world efficiently. In contemporary society, individuals use digital media to interact with the world and understand how the world works around them. </p>
      <br/>
      <p>As aforementioned, various digital mediums, including text, audio, video, and graphics, are transmitted over the internet or through other digital mediums such as television and radio. Numerous Web 2.0 tools are available online for creating digital media; some are free to use (Edjudo, 2016; Shao, 2009; Van Dijck, 2009).</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Over the last decades, the rise of electronics, software, social media, and applications has significantly impacted the democratisation of digital media creation online. This process has given individuals the power to create digital media. However, access to technology remains unequal, limiting the scope of this democratisation. The rapid evolution of technology has also created uncertainty about the future. Despite this, everyday users now have greater access to tools and skills, allowing them to experiment with digital media creation and sharing. However, this has also led to a convoluted online space with inaccurate, poorly designed, and inaccessible content (Reyna et al., 2018; Selwyn, 2015; Baumann, 2013). </p>
     <br/>
     <p>Furthermore, we are aware of the changes in contemporary society as per the introduction of digital technologies. Technologies have always impacted how societies behave and interact, for example, the introduction of electricity, telegraph, telephone, automobiles and so on and forth. Digital media currently surrounds most aspects of our lives, if not all. We rely on digital media and technologies to carry out most of our daily tasks, such as booking tickets, looking for directions, searching for recommendations, and so forth. (Uzelac, 2008; Dascal, 2006). </p>
     <br/>
     <p>The combination of digital media, the internet, mobile phones, and personal computers has significantly impacted how we view and engage with publishing, entertainment, education, commerce, politics, journalism, and other fields  (Das, 2020; Edjudo, 2016; Shao, 2009; Van Dijck, 2009).</p> 
     <br/>
     <p>Digital media can help people better understand the connections between technological change, globalisation, political institutions, historical developments, democracy, and social change. This understanding can be empowering(Das, 2020). </p>
     <br/>
     <p>Digital technologies have harmed our society, including addiction to social media, games, messaging, dating websites, and mobile phones. Other issues include digital plagiarism, copyright infringement, sexual abuse, paedophilia, cybercrimes, and social disconnection.</p>
