       <h1>User Experience, Interaction, Emotional and Inclusive Design</h1>
       <br/>
       <H2>User experience design </H2>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before designing a user experience, it is essential to understand the targeted user's needs, behaviours, motivations, and frustrations through interviews, surveys, questionnaires, and usability evaluations (usability.gov).&nbsp;</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benyon (2019) suggests a framework for UX designers called PACT, which stands for People, Activities, Contexts, and Technology. This framework helps designers understand users' needs and translate them into pleasing designs. People vary physically and psychologically, and how they use technology and systems varies. Activities are similar for all users but differ in how users undertake them. Context is associated with activities and should always be analysed together. Technology is the medium that UX designers work with. It is directly related to how technology inputs and outputs information, how it is displayed, and how it communicates with its user (Benyon, 2019).&nbsp;</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establishing the main objective and the proposed method's intended achievement is crucial when developing an interactive design. Defining the primary user group by creating frameworks describing them is the first step in understanding the user. Emotions play a significant role in the user experience, and it is essential to develop an interaction design that puts humans at the centre and searches for solutions to facilitate this interaction (usability.gov).</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preece et al. (2015) point out that when developing an interactive design, one should establish the main objective and what the proposed method tries to achieve.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unger &amp; Chandler (2012) suggest a range of &lsquo;techniques that can be used throughout the project life&rsquo; to understand the user or &lsquo;test out their behaviour&rsquo; on different site versions (Unger &amp; Chandler, 2012, chapter 6). According to Unger &amp; Chandler (2012), the first step is to define the primary user group by &lsquo;creating frameworks&rsquo; describing them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bardzell (2016) argues that a &lsquo;user&rsquo; is a person who &lsquo;completes a task within ergonomic limits&rsquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Preece et al. (2015) elaborate on the relation between emotions and the user experience, giving much thought to the &lsquo;rollercoaster of emotions that many of us experiences&rsquo; (Preece et al., 2015, pg 166). It is pretty hard to keep a user happy most of the time they interact with the design. However, developing an interaction design that puts humans in the centre and searches for solutions to facilitate this interaction is possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Hassenzahl et al. (2013) suggest, the main aim is to design &lsquo;moments of meaning and pleasure&rsquo;, trying to avoid negative experiences and frustrations when the &lsquo;user&rsquo; navigates the website. In addition, Hassenzahl et al. (2013) argue that &lsquo;the pursuit of individual happiness is central in life&rsquo; (Hassenzahl et al., 2013, pg 1), and it involves all aspects of it, including some of the most mundane tasks such as using a website.</span></p>
<br/>
<br/>
         <h2>Interaction design</h2>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cooper et al. (2007) state that interaction design shapes human behaviour. The authors argue that design methods impact people's behaviour, whether through architecture, which influences how people use physical space, or graphic design, which aims to elicit a specific response. With the advent of digital products like computers, cars, and mobile phones, user behaviour has become more complex. For example, the various technological features in modern vehicles affect how users interact with them. Interaction design draws on traditional design, usability, and engineering disciplines to address these challenges (Cooper et al., 2007, pg xvii).</span></p>
          <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Cooper et al. (2007) also argue that Interaction Design is the solution to excellent visual design creation, which is the interaction between solid design principles and patterns. According to the authors, interaction design principles are applicable guidelines for &lsquo;behaviour, form and content&rsquo; (Cooper et al., 2007, pg 150). Interaction Design aims to prioritise users' needs and goals and ensure a positive user experience in product design.</span></p>
          <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, interaction design patterns are an effort to &lsquo;formalise design knowledge and keep best practices&rsquo; to improve the quality of design solutions (Cooper et al., 2007, pg 156).&nbsp;</span></p>
          <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Interaction Design Foundation defines Interaction Design as the design of user-product interactions. When a user interacts with a product, various elements are involved, such as aesthetics, motion, sound, and space. These elements can even encompass specialised fields like sound design for creating sounds used in user interactions (</span><a class="link" href="https://www.interaction-design.org/">interaction-design.org</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Interaction and User Experience design have similarities, User Experience design is a broader field. It involves researching users, creating user personas, and conducting user and usability testing. Its primary goal is to shape the entire experience of using a product, not just the interaction between the user and the product (</span><a class="link"href="https://www.interaction-design.org/">interaction-design.org</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
          <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designers often use Interaction Design to enhance their designs and promote products. However, designers must understand that Interaction Design is not just about making applications visually appealing but also about creating a user-centric experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
          <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interaction Design focuses on how users interact with a product, from global navigation that stays visible as the user scrolls to smart suggestions that appear as the user types in a search bar. This includes buttons, links, forms, pop-ups, alerts, listings, and entire pages. Interaction Design is crucial to creating a great user experience&nbsp; (Walia, 2016; </span><a class="link" href="https://www.interaction-design.org/">interaction-design.org</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).&nbsp;</span></p>
          <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interaction design is crucial for creating engaging user experiences. It involves incorporating logical behaviours and actions into an application's elements or components to maximise value and satisfaction. By prioritising Interaction design, designers can create the best possible user experiences (Preece et al., 2015; Cao, 2015; Walia, 2016; Cooper et al., 2007).</span></p>
          <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preece et al. (2015) suggest that interaction design should focus on discovering &lsquo;requirements&rsquo; for the website and designing to fulfil them. Furthermore, Preece et al. (2015) also point out the need for a user-centred approach when developing systems and software. For this research, the main goal or requirement was to propose a visual design that enhances engagement and gives the &lsquo;user&rsquo; a memorable experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
          <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In interaction design, the concept is seated on five pillars, as explained below (Preece et al., 2015; Cao, 2015; Walia, 2016; Cooper et al., 2007):&nbsp;</span></p>
       
    <div class= "container2">

        <img src="images/five-pillars.png" height=500px width=600x alt= "Five pillars of interaction design" > 
      </div>
         </div>

         <br/>
         <ul class="visual">
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Goal-driven design</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Understanding the individuals experiencing the problem is crucial in user research. Identifying the persona of the user helps uncover relevant scenarios and issues. User stories aid in defining our goals. We can create a well-designed solution.</span></li>
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Usability</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - The term "usability" pertains to how easily a user can access and use a product or service. Usability dramatically impacts the overall user experience. The application should be user-friendly, allowing users to complete tasks without spending too much time figuring out how to use it. It should be easy to understand and use its functions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></li>
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Affordance and Signifier</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - One of the most critical goals in interaction design is creating affordance, which refers to the actions that an object or environment physically enables. When an object is designed to be clear and straightforward, users are less likely to become confused or frustrated by uncertain actions. Creating clear affordance can significantly improve the user's experience with the application and reduce their likelihood of quitting.</span></li>
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Utility</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - When determining the usefulness of a function, it is crucial to consider if it serves a purpose or solves a problem for the user. More than simply having a high-quality user interface is required. A function must have logical reasoning behind it in order to complete a valuable task. Ultimately, the user's experience and satisfaction should be the top priority.</span></li>
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>User expectations</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">  - when using an application, users expect specific reactions to their actions. Interaction design is all about confirming expected behaviour. </span></li>
        </ul>
         <br/>
         <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interaction design is crucial for creating engaging user experiences. It involves incorporating logical behaviours and actions into an application's elements or components to maximise value and satisfaction.

         <div class= "container2">

            </div>
               </div>
               <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Interaction Design Foundation cites five functional dimensions (image above) to understand the Interaction Design methodology. They are explained as follows:&nbsp;</span></p>
               <br/>
               <ul class="visual">
               <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Words - When using words in interactions, such as button labels, making them clear and easy to understand is essential. They should convey information without confusing or overwhelming the user.</span></li>
               </ul>
               <ul class="visual">
               <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Visual representations - To enhance the communication of information to users, visual representations such as images, typography, and icons are used alongside words.</span></li>
               </ul>
               <ul class="visual">
               <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Physical objects and space - determine how users interact with a product, whether a laptop with a mouse, touchpad, or smartphone with their fingers. The interaction can also be influenced by the physical surroundings in which the user is located.</span></li>
               </ul>
               <ul class="visual">
               <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Time -&nbsp; refers to media that includes animation, videos, and sounds that change over time. These elements provide visual and audio feedback to users during their interaction. Users should be able to track their progress and resume their interaction later.</span></li>
               </ul>
               <ul class="visual">
               <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Behaviour - the aspect of a product or website refers to how users interact with it, including their actions and emotional responses and feedback. This includes the mechanism of the product and how it operates.</span></li>
               </ul>
               <br />
               <br/>
               <h2>Emotional Design</h2>
               <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This statement takes us to the three levels of emotional design: visceral, behavioural and reflective. According to Norman (2004), the visceral level of design is entirely out of our control; it is almost an instinctive reaction. Visceral design relates to &lsquo;physical features&rsquo;, such as the look and feel of a design. It is often associated with sleekness, elegance and excitement. Therefore, it is highly concerned with appearances, how an object or product looks and how they make a user feel about it. It is often called deep-rooted, unconscious, subjective, and intuitive feelings.&nbsp;</span></p>
               <br/>
               <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behavioural design refers to &lsquo;performance, pleasure and effectiveness of use&rsquo; (Norman, 2004; Interaction Design Foundation). This level of design is prevalent amongst the usability community as what matters for this level is &lsquo;function, understandability, usability and physical feel&rsquo; (Norman, 2004, pg 70). Behavioural designers are interested in how users do their activities and how effectively and accurately users achieve their objectives when using a product design. Therefore, a behavioural design must pass the preliminary test of whether it fulfils users' needs.&nbsp;</span></p>
               <br/>
               <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last level of design proposed by Norman (2004) is the reflective design, described as &lsquo;all about the message, culture, and the meaning of a product design or its use&rsquo; (Norman, 2004, pg 83). It is considered the highest level of emotional design, in which designers give much thought and attention.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <div class= "container2">
                <div class="Img">
                    <img src="images/three-levels-of-emotional-design.png" height=450px width=900px alt= "The three levels of emotional design" > 
                  </div>
                     </div>
                     <h2>Inclusive Design</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joyce (2022) states that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inclusive design involves creating products accommodating people from all backgrounds and abilities. This approach considers accessibility, age, economic status, location, language, and race.</span>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Microsoft Inclusive Design project, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inclusive Design is a methodology that originates from digital environments and caters to human diversity. It emphasises the inclusion and incorporation of people with varied perspectives. The Project developed by Microsoft defines principles that guide designers when developing a digital design. Recognising exclusion, acknowledging biases, and learning from diversity are important to solve problems that extend to as many people as possible.</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Joyce (2022) highlights that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a thorough comprehension of user backgrounds and abilities drives inclusive product experiences. Prioritising inclusive design in digital interfaces can &lsquo;positively impact the user experience by creating a sense of belonging&rsquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waller et al. (2015) approach Inclusive Design as the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">success in developing a product, which involves understanding the diversity within the population and making informed design decisions that respond to this diversity. Furthermore, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waller et al. (2015) state that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inclusive design involves considering customer diversity when designing mainstream products. This approach aims to meet the needs of a wider range of people and ultimately achieve commercial success.</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often Interaction Design is compared to Universal Design, which involves creating products that can be used by individuals with a wide range of abilities and in various situations. What is the difference between them? When UX designers use universal design, they may classify individuals who do not fit the mould of an "average user" as an "edge case," unfortunately, this can lead to overlooking their unique needs. Inclusive design, however, considers both the needs of the average user and those with special circumstances (Joyce, 2022; Persson et al., 2015; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waller et al., 2015).</span></p>
