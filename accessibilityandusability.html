       <h1>Accessibility and Usability</h1>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When developing and designing a website and web tools, it is imperative to ensure that accessibility elements are in place to guarantee access for all users, regardless if they access the Internet via mainstream or assistive technology. Accessibility and usability should be taken into consideration when developing a visual design.&nbsp;</span></p>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <H2>Accessibility </H2>
       <p><strong><em>&ldquo;The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.&rdquo; Tim Berners-Lee</em></strong></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is essential to recognise that web accessibility involves creating user-friendly websites for as many people as possible. This best practice in web development aims to promote inclusivity. (Mozilla Developers; The Interaction Design Foundation).&nbsp;</span></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The web accessibility approach involves &lsquo;making web content available to all individuals&rsquo; (Mankoff et al., 2005), regardless if web users have any type of disability, such as visual impairment or neuromotor, or might experience environmental constraints ( Petrie et al., 2015).</span></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People with disabilities can use websites and web tools if designed and coded correctly. Unfortunately, many sites and tools have accessibility barriers that make them inaccessible to some individuals. It is essential to make the web accessible because it benefits individuals, businesses, and society as a whole. International web standards provide guidelines for ensuring accessibility (W3C)</span></p>
      <br/>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their research, Mankoff et al. (2005) cite that in 1995, there were 8.1 million Americans who had visual impairments, with 1.3 million being blind. In 1999, it was reported that 196,000 Americans over 15 with a "severe limitation in seeing" had access to the internet, with half of them being regular computer users. Since then, the number of blind regular computer and web users has only increased. However, many web pages are still inaccessible, with over half of the 50 most popular websites being only partly accessible or inaccessible (Sullivan &amp; Matson, 2000). Blind users often experience problems ranging from minor annoyances, such as poorly named links, to critical issues that require them to abandon a task or get sighted help, such as important text displayed only in a graphic or form fields with incorrect or missing labels and names. One example of a critical accessibility problem that sighted users may view as innocuous or annoying is popup windows (Mankoff et al., 2005).</span></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Statista website, approximately 13.3 million people in the UK have a disability. Among them, 8% of men and 0.5% of women are colour-blind, while 10% of the UK population have dyslexia. Additionally, over 2 million people in the UK have sight loss, and 19% of the population suffer from hearing loss, of which 6.5 million are over 60. Moreover, 1.5 million people in the UK have a learning difficulty, and 2.4 million people have issues with manual dexterity.</span></p> 
      <br/>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) establishes standards for accessible design. It is available at Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), such as using a content management system (CMS) that supports accessibility standards, using alt text on content-enhancing images, improving visibility with careful colour selection and contrast, using HTML elements adequately, keyboard access, and so forth (W3C, Interaction Design Foundation, Mozilla Developers).&nbsp;</span></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) - Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) also develops guidelines that are highly regarded as the international standard for web accessibility and strongly recommends that websites and web tools are designed and coded in a way that those users who have any degree of disability can access and use them. According to W3C WAI, when a website or web tool is accessible, individuals, society, and organisations benefit. Tim Berners-Lee, W3C director and inventor of the World Wide Web, argues that &ldquo;the power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect&rdquo; (W3C).</span></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidelines for an accessible website include a variety of recommendations to support developers and designers in making the web an accessible and inclusive place. According to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, there are four different principles that designers should pay attention to when developing and designing a website:</span></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1) </span><strong>Perceivable</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - users should be able to easily perceive the information and user interface components. They should be presented and displayed. This principle encompasses the following guidelines: a) text alternatives: providing text alternatives for any non-text content, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language; b) time-based media: providing alternatives for time-based media; c) adaptability: offering content that can be presented in alternative ways without losing its informational and structural capabilities; d) distinguishable: users being able to see and hear content, being able to separate foreground from background successfully.</span></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2) </span><strong>Operable </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- an interface must not include features and functionalities that a user cannot operate. This principle englobes the following guidelines: a) keyboard accessible: this means that all functionality of the content has to be operable through the keyboard, for instance; b) enough time: giving enough time for users to read and use the content available; c) avoiding seizures: do not design content that may cause or being known by causing seizures in people. d) navigable: developing and providing ways that users can navigate, find content, and determine where they are.</span></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3) </span><strong>Understandable</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable. This principle suggests the following guidelines: a) readable: all texts must be readable and understandable so that the user can make sense of it; b) predictable: making sure that web pages behave and operate predictably with consistent navigation and identification; c) input assistance: providing enough help for users to be able to avoid and correct mistakes.</span></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4) </span><strong>Robust </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by various user agents, including assistive technologies.</span></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN), accessibility means creating content that can be easily used by people with different physical and cognitive abilities, no matter how they access the web. This not only helps those with disabilities but also benefits other users, like those on mobile devices or with slow internet connections.</span></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MDN website guides how to use HTML correctly for better website accessibility. It emphasises the importance of using appropriate HTML elements &lsquo;for their intended purpose&rsquo;. For instance, HTML &lt;buttons&gt; have default styling and keyboard accessibility features, which can be overridden if necessary. Users can easily navigate between buttons using the Tab key and select them with Space, Return, or Enter keys</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (<a  class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML">MDN</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, developers from the MDN website also highlight that semantic HTML is easier to develop with, has a better mobile display and is suitable for SEO - to help customers find documents more accessible, it is essential to include keywords in headings, links, and other semantic elements rather than in non-semantic &lt;divs&gt;. Search engines prioritise these elements when indexing content</span> (</span><a class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML">MDN</a>).</span></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the MDN website provides extra guidance for coding with screen reader users in mind. Creating well-structured content is an effective way to improve accessibility. This includes headings, paragraphs, and lists. An example of a reasonable structure provided by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><a class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML">MDN</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">would be as follow:</span></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;p&gt;This is the first section of my document.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;p&gt; I will add another paragraph here, too.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;ol&gt;</span></p>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;Here is&lt;/li&gt;</span></p>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;a list for&lt;/li&gt;</span></p>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;you to read&lt;/li&gt;</span></p>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;/ol&gt;</span></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;h2&gt;My subheading&lt;/h2&gt;</span></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;p&gt;</span></p>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first subsection of my document. I would love people to be able to</span></p>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;find this content!</span></p>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;h2&gt;My 2nd subheading&lt;/h2&gt;</span></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;p&gt;</span></p>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second subsection of my content, which is more interesting</span></p>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;than the last one.</span></p>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following a semantic HTML structure, as in the example above, is fundamental for screen readers to read each header and to help distinguish headings from paragraphs. They pause after each element, and the website users can navigate at their own pace. They can also jump to the next or previous heading or use a list of all headings as a table of contents to find specific content.</span></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When coding a website, it is essential to use proper semantics in CSS and JavaScript to ensure accessibility. The</span> <a class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/CSS_and_JavaScript">MDN website</a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">offers helpful advice on selecting appropriate font sizes, line heights, and letter spacing for text to make it easy to read. Use a more extensive and bolder font than the body text to make headings stand out. Similarly, lists should be formatted to look like lists. Additionally, ensuring that the text colour contrasts nicely with the background colour to improve legibility is vital.</span></p>
       <br/>
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why are the principles of accessibility important when designing and developing websites and web tools? As aforementioned, this research understands that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it is important to develop HTML and CVSS codes that incorporate these principles semantically to make websites and web tools accessible. For example, by providing text alternatives for non-text content, blind users can access images, and they can be easily read by screen readers or text-to-speech software, or even text-to-Braille hardware. Also, if text and images can be enlarged, those users with visual-impairment disabilities can see them. Using colours carefully to avoid making it hard to read or perceive, ensuring that links are underlined or somehow differentiated, not only coloured, provides accessibility to colour-blind users. Making features and functionalities accessible through a keyboard helps navigation and does not exclude those who can thoroughly control a computer mouse.</span></p>

          <h2>Usability</h2>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nielsen Norman Group defines usability as a &lsquo;quality attribute&rsquo; that helps assess whether an interface is easy to use and accomplish a task. The group suggests five main quality components, listed below:</span></p>
          <br/>
          <ul class="visual">
          <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learnability - When a user first encounters the design, does he/she find it easy to carry out a task?&nbsp;</span></li>
          <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efficiency - Once users are familiar with the interface design, do they efficiently perform tasks or encounter difficulties?</span></li>
          <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memorability - Can users recall how to use the interface design once they return to it after a period of absence? Is the interface design easy to remember?&nbsp;</span></li>
          <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Errors - How easily can users learn from errors and mistakes? Can they recover from these errors and perform the intended task?</span></li>
          <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Satisfaction - Do users enjoy using the interface? Does it give users satisfaction in using the design?</span></li>
          </ul >
          <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usability is vital for the interface's success; if users find it hard to use, they will not have memorable experiences and will likely not return to it.</span></p>
          <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User experience and usability are closely related. According to the International Standard for Standardisation, user experience refers to a person's perception and response when using a product, system, or service. In other words, a website or app's overall feeling and perception depend on its usability. If a website is challenging to navigate, find information or purchase, the user experience will likely be poor. Conversely, if a website is easy to use and navigate, the user experience will be satisfying. Therefore, usability is crucial in ensuring a positive user experience (</span><a class="link" href="https://www.nngroup.com/">The Nielsen Norman Group</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a class="link" href="https://www.interaction-design.org/">The Interaction Design Foundation</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
          <br/>
          <div class= "container2">
            <div class="Img">
                <img src="images/usability-for-the-web.png" height=400px width=750x alt= "Usability for the web" > 
              </div>
                 </div>
                 <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Preece et al. (2015), usability goals typically aim to meet specific criteria related to efficiency, while user experience goals focus on understanding the nature of the user's experience, such as creating an aesthetically pleasing experience. In addition, Preece et al. (2015) argue that usability and user experience are intertwined. While usability is crucial, appearance and feel also impact the user experience. It is essential to consider both when designing. Human-Computer Interaction has expanded to cover broader user experience beyond usability (Preece et al., 2015, pg19).</span></p>
          <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Benyon (2019), a highly usable system should possess the following qualities:</span></p>
          <br/>
          <ul class="visual">
          <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be efficient, meaning users can complete tasks with minimal effort.</span></li>
          <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be adequate and appropriately organised with the necessary functions and information.</span></li>
          <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be easy to learn and remember how to use.</span></li>
          <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be safe to use in various contexts.&nbsp;</span></li>
          <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should provide a high level of utility by fulfilling the tasks users need to accomplish.</span></li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gould and Lewis (1985) write that when creating a system for people to use, it should be designed to be quickly learned and remembered. Additionally, it should be helpful by containing functions necessary for their work while being user-friendly and enjoyable.</span></p>
          <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three key principles Gould and Lewis (1985) recommended are as follows:</span></p>
          <br/>
          <ul class="visual">
          <li><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early focus on users and tasks - designers need to know their target audience. This involves studying their &lsquo;cognitive, behavioural, anthropometric, and attitudinal characteristics&rsquo; and the type of work they will do.</span></strong></li>
          </ul>
          <ul class="visual">
          <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Empirical Measurement - to ensure the effectiveness of the development process, it is advisable to involve intended users in the early stages and have them use simulations and prototypes to perform actual tasks. It is important to closely observe, record, and analyse their performance and reactions.</span></li>
          <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iterative design - problems are bound to arise in user testing and must be addressed. This calls for an iterative design process that involves a repeated cycle of designing, testing, measuring, and redesigning until all issues are resolved.</span></li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          <br />
          <h2>How do accessibility and usability relate?</span></h2>
           <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accessibility ensures web access for all people regardless of whether they use assistive or mainstream technology. On the other hand, usability is all about designing effective, efficient, and satisfying products. The two concepts overlap and are crucial to the overall user experience. If a website or web tool is not accessible to users with assistive technology, it becomes unusable and fails its usability. Unfortunately, accessibility is not always included in the usability elements of a web or web tool, despite its importance.</span></p>
