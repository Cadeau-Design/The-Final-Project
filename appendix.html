       <H2>Methodology</H2>  

       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This study explores user experience phenomena through exploratory research and secondary research. Understanding your design research data is crucial in order to generate valuable insights that can be acted upon. This research will apply the interpretivism theoretical perspective, focusing on social interaction as the basis for knowledge.</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interpretivism focuses its approach on &lsquo;social interaction as the basis for knowledge&rsquo; (O&rsquo;Donoghue, 2007), to understand and make meaning of the world the individual must interpret it (Schwandt, 1994). It allows the researcher to analyse the study in-depth, with &ldquo;greater sophistication without a statistically secure universalisation of findings&rdquo; (Hackley, 2003, pg 7). According to Malhotra et al (2017), the interpretive intends to explore the research question in a &ldquo;dynamic, participant-constructed and evolving nature of reality&rdquo; (Malhotra et al, 2017, pg 69), taking into more significant consideration that there might be a wide range of interpretations of &lsquo;realities or social acts&rsquo;, the interpretive researcher is interested &lsquo;in understanding the meaning behind something&rsquo; (Habermas,1972).</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The British Design Council has developed a design framework called Double Diamond, which suggests that the design process should have four stages. </span></p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first stage is Discover, leading the designer to understand the problem rather than guessing it. In the case of this research, this is represented by understanding the needs of those looking to challenge their issues by doing physical exercises and training.</span></p>
<br/>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the second stage, Define: the insights gathered from the discovery phase can help define the problem. Concerning this study, the secondary data was collected through exploratory and secondary research.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br/>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third stage, Develop: different answers lead to seeking inspiration for the design. Preece et al. (2015) suggest that during this stage, Develop is where the &lsquo;design, prototyping and construction&rsquo; is created. In addition, interaction design and the final product come alive through &lsquo;repeated design-evaluation-redesign cycles involving prototypes&rsquo; (Preece et al., 2015, pg421 ).&nbsp;</span></p>
<br/>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fourth and final stage is called Deliver, which involves testing proposed solutions and eliminating those that do not work. </span></p>
  <br/>

       <H2>1. Home page</H2>  

       <div class= "container5">
        <div class="Img">  
          <img src="images/wireframe-one.png" height=550px width=450px alt= "wireframe version one for Mind and Sould website." > 
          </div>
          <div>
            
          <img src="images/landing-page-first-version.png" height=550px width=750px alt= "version one for Mind and Sould website." > 
        </div>
        </div>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The design above illustrates the homepage for the Your Mind and Soul website. With clear call-to-action buttons, the users are invited to start their journey with the program and discover their souls.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <br/>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The message is plain, direct and uncomplicated. It is a simple design that uses attractive imagery, H1, for the main message on the right-hand side. The colours chosen, purple for the navigation tab and dark blue for the footer, harmoniously integrate into the design and complement each other. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
        <br/>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The font family is Ubuntu, which has been used throughout this project. </span></p>
        <br/>
       <br/>
       <H2>2. Home page - second version</H2>  

       <div class= "container5">
        <div class="Img">  
          <img src="images/wireframe-two.png" height=550px width=450px alt= "wireframe version two for Mind and Sould website." > 
          </div>
          <div>
            
          <img src="images/landing-page-second-version.png" height=550px width=750px alt= "version two for Mind and Sould website." > 
        </div>
        </div>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the second home page version, the design has only one call to action, narrowing the expected response from the users.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <br/>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The message is more direct and straight to the point. It is also a&nbsp; simple design that uses the same attractive imagery, H1, for the main message on the right-hand side. The colours chosen are dark blue for the whole page, harmoniously integrated into the design and embracing the look and feel of the main header image. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
        <br/>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The font family is Ubuntu, which has been used throughout this project. </span></p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <H2>3. Home page - third version</H2>  

       <div class= "container5">
        <div class="Img">  
          <img src="images/wireframe-three.png" height=550px width=450px alt= "wireframe version three for Mind and Sould website." > 
          </div>
          <div>
            
          <img src="images/desktop-one.png" height=1000px width=450px alt= "version two for Mind and Sould website." > 
        </div>
        </div>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the third home page version, the design offers more opportunities for the user to engage with the website, aiming to broaden the experience by offering different options for the users to start their journey. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
        <br/>  
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right at the top of the webpage is a hamburger menu that allows users to explore the website, navigating through the subpages.</span></p>
          <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main message above the fold is direct and straight to the point, &lsquo;Start your journey&rsquo;. It is also a striking design that uses the same attractive imagery, H1, for the main message on the right-hand side. The colours chosen are teal and dark blue, harmoniously integrating into the design and embracing the look and feel of the main header image and the image at the bottom of the webpage.</span></p>
          <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, this webpage lists the six primary services offered by the program. The six blocks are hyperlinked and interactive, taking the user to the dedicated subpages for each service. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
          <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The font family is Ubuntu, which has been used throughout this project. </span></p>
          
        <br/>
        <br/>

        <H2>4. Home page - fourth version with slider/carousel</H2>  

        <div class= "container5">
         <div class="Img">  
           <img src="images/wireframe-four.png" height=550px width=450px alt= "wireframe version four for Mind and Sould website." > 
           </div>
           <div>
             
           <img src="images/desktop-2-with-carousel.png" height=1400px width=450px alt= "version four for Mind and Sould website." > 
         </div>
         </div>
 
         <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This concept has two different elements added to it. There is a services slider/carousel where the users can slide through the services and try the six different options for their programs. For better experience try seeing this project on </span><a class="link" href="https://www.figma.com/file/Hj7nn9uKch3vBBIyGfvNJ3/Your-mind-and-soul-project?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=IlQkCHHpp9RC3zIt-0">Figma.com</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
         
         <br/>  
         <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, resources components was added to this design, offering the user the option to read the blog, watch videos or listen to podcasts.</span></p>
           <br/>
           <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The colour schem follows the colours available on the aolour palette, with pink as the main first colour, adding some electric feeling, further down is the slider with purple being the colour of the first slide. Resources is in cyan and footer remains in dark blue.</span></p>
           <br/>
           <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The font family is Ubuntu, which has been used throughout this project. </span></p>
           
         <br/>
         <br/>

         <H2>4. Subpages</H2>  

         <div class= "container5">
          <div class="Img">                
            <img src="images/Subpages.png" height=600px width=350px alt= "subpages version for Mind and Sould website." > 
          </div>

                    </div>
  
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of the subpages follows the design of the main landing page fourth version with a slider/carousel.</span></p>
          <br/>  
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The header banner containing a page title on the left hand-side and a call-to-action button just bellow it.</span></p>
            <br/>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below the header banner is where the main content is displayed.</span></p>
            <br/>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Followed by the ‘Looking for a challenge?’ banner and the footer at the bottom. </span></p>
            
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <H2>Limitations</H2>  
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main limitations of this research, considering the knowledge acquired throughout the process, was the lack of primary data.</span></p>
         <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, to improve and further understand the problem in the Discover phase, as suggested by the British Design Council, it must involve speaking to and spending time with the users affected by the issue.</span></p>
          <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benyon (2019) argues that UX design should &lsquo;put people first, it should be human-centred&rsquo; (Benyon, 2019, pg 25). He suggests a guide for UX designers called PACT, which is People, represented by personas (profiles of potential users), Activities and Contexts are to be &lsquo;envisioned through scenarios of use&rsquo;, and Technology, which represents the different technologies that will function as a way to deliver the expected user experience (Benyon, 2019, pg48).&nbsp;</span></p>
          <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, this research concludes that for future reference, it would have gathered more in-depth knowledge if this research had considered the collection of primary data through questionnaires and focus groups. </span></p>
