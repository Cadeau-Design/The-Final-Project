       <h1>Visual Design, Colour Theory and Typography</h1>
       
       <H2>Visual design </H2>
       
      
       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Interaction Design Foundation suggests there is more to visual design than aesthetics. It aims to improve a &lsquo;design/product&rsquo;s aesthetics and appeal&rsquo; (Interaction Design Foundation) by carefully using suitable images, typography, space, layout and colour. The visual design looks to develop interfaces that offer a memorable user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
       <br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a class="link" href="https://www.usability.gov/index.html"><span>usability.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, visual design involves using images, colours, fonts, and other elements to enhance the overall appearance of a website and its related materials.</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do designers develop great visual designs that ultimately can create unforgettable experiences?&nbsp;</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Watzman (2003), visual design is not a matter of personal preference for colours or trendy typefaces but rather a tangible way of representing product goals. It emphasises the appearance, method, and style of presenting information.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporating principles and tools of visual and experiential design and user perspective (information design) can increase product value, usefulness, and perception. It is the ideal blend of project goals, user perspective, and informed decision-making (Watzman, 2003; Jacko, 2012).</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Hassenzahl et al. (2013) suggested, the main aim was to design &lsquo;moments of meaning and pleasure&rsquo; to avoid negative experiences and frustrations when a user navigates through the website to gather information. In addition, Hassenzahl et al. (2013) argue that &lsquo;the pursuit of individual happiness is central in life&rsquo; (Hassenzahl et al., 2013, pg 1), involving all aspects of it, including some of the most mundane tasks such as using a website.</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of experience design that aims to provide an unforgettable experience faces fierce competition, as most designers search for ways to &lsquo;satisfy users&rsquo; needs and desires&rsquo; through the experience of design consumption (Amic, 2016; Hassenzahl et al., 2013). To handle how user experience works, designers sought to understand how users perceive the design they interact with, which involves usability, mood, feel, and look. Visual design, including images, colour, typography, lines, curves, shapes, and so forth, contributes to how users perceive and interact with the design.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hartono and Holsapple (2019) suggest that when a user is exposed to an artefact, its visual design qualities will generate cognitive and emotional responses and, therefore, most likely influence its experience or perception. Furthermore, when an individual interacts with an artefact, and in the case of this study, a website, the user will perceive its aesthetic quality as visually attractive, beautifully displayed and elegant. Of course, we also have to consider its functional qualities - if it performs well and helps achieve the user&rsquo;s goals and objectives; and the meanings and associations it elicits towards the user (Hartono &amp; Holsapple, 2019;&nbsp; Noble &amp; Kumar, 2010; Norma, 2007).&nbsp;</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Interaction Design Foundation suggests using visual design to create and organise website elements to &lsquo;lead the user&rsquo;s eye to an item&rsquo;s functionality, and make the aesthetics consistent&rsquo;. The Foundation argues that the content displayed on a webpage has to give its users the right visual cues, as it will affect how the users perceive, think, feel and are attracted to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The visual design's most known elements are listed below:</span></p>
<br/>
<ul class="visual">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Lines (straight, curved, geometric, organic)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Shapes (enclosed or self-contained areas)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colour palette (can contribute to creating theme/tone and attracting attention to the website)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texture (also related to the object&rsquo;s surface)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typography (font type, family, weight)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Negative space/whitespace</span></li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Interaction Design Foundation also suggests that visual design problems can negatively impact users and send them away almost instantly. The first impression is hugely vital to user experience and engagement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Watzman (2003), it is essential to understand the universal principles of visual organisation. These principles are the foundation for every visual decision and are present in everything we see and do. By understanding these principles, one becomes visually literate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three fundamental visual communication principles are related but distinct: </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">harmony</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">balance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">simplicity</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Harmony refers to combining different parts in a pleasing and orderly way, while balance achieves a sense of stability and comfort in design. Simplicity embodies clarity, elegance, and economy in design. Achieving visual harmony and balance can be done through symmetry or asymmetry, depending on the design. While simplicity may seem &lsquo;easy, accessible and appraocble&rsquo;,&nbsp; it often requires more skills. However, a clear and refined design should include only essential elements. Removing these elements could drastically change the composition and make it difficult to understand (Watzman, 2003, pg 266).</span></p>

         <h2>Colour Theory</h2>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is colour? Fox (2022) says that colour is our only &lsquo;constant companion&rsquo;; it stays with us all day.&nbsp;</span></p>
          <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colour </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is the light that shines on an object and bounces off it. It is a &lsquo;visual perceptual property deriving from the spectrum of light interacting with the photoreceptor cells of the eyes&rsquo; (Wikipedia; Oxford Dictionary).&nbsp;</span></p>
          <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first experiment to associate colour and light was conducted by Isaac Newton in 1676.</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newton used a triangular prism to analyse &lsquo;white sunlight into a visible spectrum of colours&rsquo; (Itten, 1965, pg 15).&nbsp;</span></p>
        <br/>
       
    <div class= "container2">
    <div class="Img">
        <img src="images/newton-prism-experiment-1666.jpg" height=400px width=600x alt= "Newton prims experiment- year 1666" > 
      </div>
         </div>

         <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his experiment, Newton observed the white sunlight entering the prism and dispersing into the spectral colours when leaving. The scientist understood that seven primary colours composed the spectrum. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He identified red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet (Itten, 1965; Bohren &amp; Clothiaux, 2006; Pantone, 2021).</span></p>
         <br/>
         <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lupton and Phillips (2015) write that colour &lsquo;can convey a mood, describe reality, or codify information&rsquo; (Lupton and Phillips, 2015, pg 81).&nbsp;</span></p>
         <br/>
         <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Itten (1965) argues that &lsquo;colour is life&rsquo;, meaning that if there were no colour in our world, it would &lsquo;appear to us as dead&rsquo; (Itten, 1965, pg 8). There is nothing more significant to the human mind than the colour itself. Consider how a rainbow affects our minds when it appears in the sky, the shades of sunset, the northern lights, the different hues of blue in the sea, the display of autumn colours or the northern lights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
         <br/>
         <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox (2022) writes that colour &lsquo;makes everything worth looking at&rsquo; (Fox, 2022, pg xiii). Edwards (2004) says that colour &lsquo;signifies life&rsquo;; planet Earth's unique colours make life worth living. The blue of our water, the green from the forests and jungles, the white sand, the red clay or the pink rose are the most extraordinary delight our minds and eyes can encounter.&nbsp;</span></p>
         <br/>
         <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Watzman (2003), colour is the most influential aspect of visual communication, as it elicits emotional solid and informational reactions. It is also symbolic due to being a shared human experience. Like fashion, colour perception and value are subject to change over time, and they can be used to evoke specific reactions or define a style. Using colours effectively can help users process and distinguish between different types and levels of information more easily. Studies indicate that using one colour effectively can enhance communication by improving speed, accuracy, and retention. However, poorly using multiple colours can reduce effectiveness (Watzman, 2003, pg 277).</span></p>
         <br/>
         <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The variety of colours in our world brings us to the colour wheel, first organised by Isaac Newton, which is still used in modern days to understand and describe the relationship between colours (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pantone, 2021; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lupton &amp; Phillips, 2015; Edwards, 2004).&nbsp;</span></p>
         <p>
    <br/>
    <div class= "container3">
      <div class="Img">
          <img src="images/martian-colour-wheel-24-hue.png" height=550px width=450x alt= "Martian colour wheel" > 
        </div>
           </div>
           <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A colour wheel is a valuable tool to designers and artists as it provides an in-depth understanding of how colours relate. It is often said that colours which sit near each other on the spectrum or are close enough to each other provide minimal colour contrast and have great harmony because they have common elements and proprieties (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pantone, 2021; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lupton &amp; Phillips, 2015; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohren &amp; Clothiaux, 2006; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edwards, 2004). These colours are called analogous colours as they &lsquo;reflect light waves that are similar&rsquo; (Edwards, 2004, p. 23). </span><br /><br /></p>
           <br/>
           <div class= "container4">
            <div class="Img">
                <img src="images/analogous-color-schemes.png" height=300px width=550x alt= "Analogous colour scheme" > 
              </div>
                 </div>
         <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analogous colours are usually a group of three that sit next to each other on the wheel, and the colour in the middle of them is often referred to as the mother colour. In the illustration above, yellow, orange-yellow and oranges are analogous colours, and the middle one is described as the mother colour (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pantone, 2021; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lupton &amp; Phillips, 2015; Edwards, 2004). Analogous colours look very elegant, precise and charming in the colour palette.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <br/>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes analogous colours can be extended to four or even five colours sitting next to each other. In the illustration below from Edwards&rsquo; book, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Color - A course in mastering the art of mixing colors, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">we can see the five colours on the left sitting nicely next to each other in an analogous scheme, bringing a sense of harmony and elegance to the eye. </span></p>
          <br/>
          <div class= "container5">
            <div class="Img">
              <img src="images/five-analogous-colours.png" height=450px width=450px alt= "five analagous colours" >
              </div>
            </div>
      <br/>
      <p>Another group of colours are the complementary colours, which sat opposite each other on the colour wheel, as shown in the illustration below. This type of combination provides a ‘high contrast and high impact colour combination’ (Pantone, 2021; Lupton & Phillips, 2015; Edwards, 2004). It is often said that complementary colours do not share any common element (figure below) and have opposite colour temperatures (Lupton & Phillips, 2015).
        </p>

            </div>
            <h2>Typography</h2>
           <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a typographer? What is typography? We constantly compose a text, arrange type, process data, and represent characters, letters, and symbols. Typography is the art, technique, or procedure of making understandable language readable and appealing and is the practice of laying out type in a design (Boss &amp; Teague, 2016; Wikipedia; Oxford Dictionary).&nbsp; The word </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">typography</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes from the Greek language </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&tau;ύ&pi;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></em> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">typos</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> "form" or "impression" and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&gamma;&rho;ά&phi;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;</span></em> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">graphein</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> "to write" (Wikipedia).&nbsp;</span></p>
           <br/>
           <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As aforementioned, typography is how we arrange type in a design. It deals with various elements such as size, spacing, colour, styles of type, weight, and format. The practice of typography also involves other related matters; for instance, a typographer might consider the selection of paper, the type of ink to be used, and how it will bind together pages in a book or a printing. It also relates to other components in a page or webpage, such as photographs, illustrations, shapes, and the interface itself </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Well &amp; Preece, 2020; Boss &amp; Teague, 2016)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
           <br/>
           <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warden (1956), in her essay, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Crystal Goblet, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">states that &ldquo; the front door of the science of typography&rdquo; (Warden, 1956, p. 12) is that &ldquo;printing is what conveys thought, ideas, images, from one mind to the other&rdquo; (Warden, 1956, p. 12).&nbsp;</span></p>
           <br/>
           <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well and Preece (2020) write that the typographer is not expressing his &lsquo;aesthetic views and needs&rsquo; but allowing a &lsquo;connection between someone who has something to say and someone to say it to&rsquo; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Well &amp; Preece, 2020).</span></p>
           <br/>
           <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boss and Teague (2016) argue that everyone nowadays is a typographer. We go to a computer and type anything on the word processor, which makes us a typographer. Concerning whether what we type is beautiful or good is up to how committed we are. How committed we are to kerning, leading, and tracking.&nbsp;</span></p>
           <br/>
           <div class= "container7">
      <div class="Img">
        <img src="images/typography.jpg" height=250px width=450px alt= "Typography" >
        </div>
        </div>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spiekermann and Ginger (2003) state that typography is everywhere. It is hard to picture our contemporary world without &lsquo;type&rsquo;. Furthermore, they say that newspapers get their &lsquo;look and feel&rsquo; from the type they choose, and readers recognise their favourite papers because they have a distinct look (Spiekermann &amp; Ginger, 2003).</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watzman (2003) defines typography as the foundation of visual design and involves &lsquo;defining and arranging the appearance of the type&rsquo; (Watzman, 2003, pg 268). Mastering this skill is crucial in visual design since it is the &lsquo;smallest definable part of a design&rsquo;, like a pixel to a screen display. A thorough understanding of typography principles can be transferred to complex design issues such as &lsquo;page and product design&rsquo; (Watzman, 2003, pg 268). The choice of typeface affects legibility, which is the ability to read and comprehend what is written.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, Watzman (2003) suggests that selecting the right typeface takes experience and understanding since an enormous variety of typefaces are available and different ways to manipulate them (Watzman, 2003).&nbsp;</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Watzmann (2003) points out that choosing the right typography can significantly enhance the reading experience, making it effortless and enjoyable. On the other hand, choosing the wrong font can cause frustration and fatigue, impacting product acceptance and setting a negative mood. For instance, outdated typefaces can make a newsletter look old-fashioned, while typefaces with thick and thin strokes can make a web page unreadable. As such, designers must clearly understand typography principles to make informed choices (Watzman, 2003, pg 268).</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rutter (2017) also argues that we are all typographers and that web typography matters, as he agrees with Warden (1956) on the fact that typography allows a message to go from one mind to the other, or in other words, connects the author and the reader (Rutter, 2017). Further, the author points out that most web content consists of words, which questions the reading experience. Therefore, how the words are displayed on the web needs to contribute to the reader&rsquo;s experience.</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Reichenstein (2011) writes that &lsquo; web design is about 95% typography&rsquo;.&nbsp; Why does the author argue that? He argues that&nbsp; &lsquo;95% of the web information is written language&rsquo; (Rutter, 2017, pg3)., which takes us to understand that a web designer should get typography training as it is the primary discipline that gives written information its shape, feel and look.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is typography an art? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well and Preece (2020) suggest that it is not fine art despite fine typography. The authors approach it as a helpful art because it provides a bridge between the writer and the reader and takes into consideration aesthetics, taste, and imagination.</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rutter (2017) quotes the designer Herman Zapf to argue that typography is sometimes misinterpreted as a &lsquo;form of private self-expression&rsquo;. In addition, the author also points to another designer Emil Ruder, to explain that the &lsquo;one plain duty&rsquo; of typography is to deliver information in writing (Rutter, 2017, pg4).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
