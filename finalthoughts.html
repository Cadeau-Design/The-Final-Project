       <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This research delved into techniques for creating engaging and interactive websites. It analysed the importance of visual aesthetics, colour theory, typography, accessibility, user-friendliness, user experience, interaction, and inclusive design throughout development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This study used exploratory and secondary research to examine the user experience while focusing on social interaction as the basis for knowledge from an interpretivism theoretical perspective.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To better comprehend digital media's impact on modern society, it was necessary to investigate the concept of digital media and how its popularity and use have evolved with the introduction of computers, smartphones, tablets, and watches over the past few decades.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the emergence of Web 2.0, which allows users to create content rather than solely access information, provides users with a more profound and engaging experience.</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital media has both positive and negative impacts on society. It has become vital for navigating the world; people use it to interact and understand their surroundings. Various mediums are transmitted over the internet, and tools are available for creating digital media.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has given individuals the power to create, but technology access still needs improvement. Digital media is crucial for various fields but can also cause addiction and harm society</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visual design enhances product appeal and user experience by using images, typography, layout, space, and colour to improve website appearance.</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This research also understands that designers achieve visually appealing designs by creating tangible representations of product goals. The main objective is to design "moments of meaning and pleasure" to prevent negative experiences and frustrations while navigating the website.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fundamental visual design elements are lines, shapes, colour palette, texture, typography, and negative space or whitespace. Understanding the universal principles of visual organisation is crucial to achieving harmony, balance, and simplicity.</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colour is a characteristic of light that we perceive through our eyes. Isaac Newton identified seven primary colours: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. Colour can communicate emotions, represent reality or organise data. It is the most potent element of visual communication, but misusing multiple colours can decrease its impact. Designers and artists use the colour wheel to comprehend the connection between colours. Analogous colours blend well, while complementary colours create a striking contrast.</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The colour scheme chosen for the design/website concept illustrated in the Wireframes and Concepts section is as follows: Dark Cyan (RGB 0, 56, 67 HEX #008eaa), Dark Blue (RGB 0, 21, 58 HEX #003594), Vivid Orange (RGB 100, 78, 17 HEX #ffc72c), Very Dark Magenta (RGB 39, 15, 40 HEX #642667), as primary colour scheme.</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the following HEX numbers were used as a secondary colour scheme: #B033A4 (Dark Pink), #11406D (Very Dark Cyan), #208ECF (Strong Cyan), #1F6B47 (Very Dark Cyan - Lime Green), #B03333 (Dark Red), #ffffff (White) and #000000 (Black).</span></p>

        </div>

         
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox (2022) identifies three types of colour meanings. The first is based on affective psychology, such as red being energetic and brown being lethargic. The second is based on social conventions, such as red signals indicating warnings and white flags indicating surrender. The third type is generated by association and is the richest historically.</span></p>
        <br/>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this research, dark blue was chosen as a primary colour for its elegance, authority and intelligence. It signifies professionalism and reliability. Dark magenta was chosen for being known to encourage people to be original and creative, daring to be themselves by expressing their authentic version. Dark cyan was picked for the project as it provides a complementary contrast against the magenta hue. The vivid orange, chosen for the call-to-action buttons, brings enthusiasm and cheerfulness and gives an extra layer of attraction to the human eye (</span><a class="link" href="https://www.color-meanings.com/">Colour-Meanings</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
        <br/>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typography plays a vital role in visual design by choosing and arranging fonts. It impacts readability and can either improve or diminish the reading experience. Typography is more significant in web design since most web content comprises text. Although not considered fine art, typography is a valuable art that connects the author and the audience. Its main objective is to convey information through writing.</span></p>
        <br/>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The font family chosen for this project is Ubuntu. It was selected for its clarity and accessibility in print and on-screen media. Additionally, it is available in various weights and styles and is a sans-serif, OpenType-based humanist typeface. It was initially developed as the default font of the Ubuntu operating system, with its spacing and kerning optimized for body copy sizes (</span><a class="link" href="https://www.figma.com/google-fonts/ubuntu-font-pairings/#:~:text=Ubuntu%20is%20a%20sans%2Dserif,optimised%20for%20body%20copy%20sizes.">Figma.com</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
    <div class= "container5">
      <div class="Img">

      </div>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When designing a website or web tools, it is crucial to incorporate accessibility features for all users, regardless of whether they use mainstream or assistive technology. Web accessibility involves creating websites that are user-friendly and accessible to as many people as possible. International web standards offer guidelines to ensure accessibility, promote inclusivity and benefit individuals, businesses, and society.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <br/>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usability is crucial for the success of an interface. The Nielsen Norman Group identifies five quality components: learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors, and satisfaction. A highly usable system should be efficient, organised, easy to learn and remember, safe, and valuable. To achieve this, designers should focus on users and tasks early on and employ an iterative design process.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <br/>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When creating a user experience, it is crucial to understand the needs, behaviours, motivations, and frustrations of the target audience through interviews, surveys, questionnaires, and usability evaluations. PACT, a framework developed by Benyon (2019) for UX designers, stands for People, Activities, Contexts, and Technology. This framework helps designers comprehend the user's needs and transform them into aesthetically pleasing designs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
      <br/>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design impacts human behaviour, both physically and digitally. Interaction design focuses on user-product interactions, including aesthetics and specialized fields. It emphasises user needs and goals for a positive experience. It is essential to prioritise the user experience, not just aesthetics and encompasses various aspects such as navigation, buttons, forms, and pages. By prioritising Interaction Design, designers can create engaging user experiences.</span></p>
      <br/>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emotional design has three levels: visceral, behavioural, and reflective. The visceral level focuses on appearance, evoking positive feelings. Behavioural design prioritises usability and effectiveness. Reflective design conveys a meaningful message and connection to users. Combining all three levels results in products that look good, function well, and have a deeper meaning.</span></p>
      <br/>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inclusive design involves creating products that cater to people from all backgrounds and abilities, considering factors like accessibility, age, economic status, location, language, and race. This methodology originates from digital environments and emphasises the importance of including people with different perspectives in the design process. The inclusive design considers the needs of the average user and those with exceptional circumstances, aiming to meet the needs of a broader range of people</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
      <br/>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This study emphasised the importance of creating visually appealing, user-friendly, and accessible websites that consider colour theory, typography, usability, emotional and inclusive design, and user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <br/>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, this research concludes that designers must focus on users and tasks early on, understand user needs, and employ an iterative design process to create efficient, organised, easy-to-learn, safe, and valuable systems that comply with international web standards.</span></p>
